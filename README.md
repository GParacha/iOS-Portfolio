OhTheHorror: In Development, currently making the assets for said game. I have focused on making atmospheric pixel art and certain backgrounds. I have worked with my team to create an atmosphere of fear.

FencinApp: Finished, created assets and app for Android. A one on one strategy game with increasingly more difficult bosses, each with their own AI. I made characters of different colors, assets and even motions. The app has been lost however.
