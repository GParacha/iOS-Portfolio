Hey I am Gaurav Paracha, and I have done work in many Computer Science classes. I have focused on creating pixel art for said projects and becoming a better group member.

OhTheHorror: In Development, currently making the assets for said game. I have focused on making atmospheric pixel art and certain backgrounds. I have worked with my team to create an atmosphere of fear.

FencinApp: Finished, created assets and app for Android. A one on one strategy game with increasingly more difficult bosses, each with their own AI. I made characters of different colors, assets and even motions. The app taught me how to design enemy ai with a certain amount of personality and how to show movement. It was often a challenge for simple things I hadn't thought about beforehand. Things like buttons or even how to program a healthbar. The app has been lost however.
