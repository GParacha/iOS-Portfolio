# iOS-Portfolio
Hey I am Gaurav Paracha, and I have done work in many Computer Science classes. I have focused on creating pixel art for said projects and becoming a better group member. I have pushed myself through AP CSP and iOS App Development and learned a lot along the way.

**OhTheHorror:**
- Canceled, was making the assets for said game. I have focused on making atmospheric pixel art and certain backgrounds. I have worked with my team to create an atmosphere of fear. This app taught me how to work with a team of more than just myself. I worked with amazing people who always pushed me to go even further than what I thought I was capable of. It also taught me how to work with clients that want very specific things.

**CrusaderDungeon:**
- In production, currently designing characters. I focused on making memorable character designs that would be iconic to the project. I learnt how to support my team member since this was a two man project. I especially learnt how to talk to outside sources to get help in areas I didn't know about. We were able to work through many setbacks to make a functional product that could at some point be on the appstore.

**FencinApp:** 
- Finished, created assets and app for Android. A one on one strategy game with increasingly more difficult bosses, each with their own AI. I made characters of different colors, assets and even motions. The app taught me how to design enemy ai with a certain amount of personality and how to show movement. It was often a challenge for simple things I hadn't thought about beforehand. Things like buttons or even how to program a healthbar. The app has been lost however.

**Personal Projects:**
- While I had free time, I had worked on a few art projects to get more experience with pixel art. By no means have they been the greatest things to touch the earth, but they can be pretty close. I have learnt a strong eye for rendering, making each environment pop like they were real places. Alongside lighting that was my main issue. I learnt a process that worked for me and got me to have fun while doing it.
